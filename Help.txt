To compile and run the project from the command line

1) Make sure you have the JDK installed

2) Open the command line(On windows, use Windows Key + R and then type in cmd)

3) Locate the directory where you have downloaded the program e.g. C:\Users\ThisUser\Documents\Projects\Group20\java
Change to this directory in the command line using the cd command as follows,
cd C:\Users\ThisUser\Documents\Projects\Group20\java

4) Locate the directory where the JDK is installed on your computer and set the path there as follows,
set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15\bin

5) Compile the java program with the javac command as follows,
javac GuiRun.java
or
javac CommandLineRun.java

Note: Nothing should happen in the command line after this command but if you type in dir then you should find
a GuiRun.class or CommandLineRun.class file. This confirms that the code has been compiled.

6) Run the code using the java command as follows,
java GuiRun.java
or
java CommandLineRun.java
